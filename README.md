# Project Inertia

*“Keep your ideas in motion.”*

Everyone has brilliant ideas collecting dust. Inertia turns those sketches into motion — analyzing, validating, and translating them into structured blueprints (PRFAQs, architectures, or prototypes). It’s like having an AI strategy and product co-founder who never gets tired of brainstorming.
